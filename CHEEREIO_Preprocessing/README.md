This is the filter and master script for my preprocessing code.

It contains, most importantly, an implementation of the xESMF regridding package originating in GCpy but customized for satellite data rather than model-focused purposes. The key difference fromthe L2L_regridder in GCpy is that I allow for the use of regridding algorithms asie from 'conservative' (the only option in GCpy.L2L_regridder). This code accepts the following ESMF regridding methods: bilinear, conservative, conservative_normed, patch, nearest_s2d, nearest_d2s. See https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/Compare_algorithms.html for details.
